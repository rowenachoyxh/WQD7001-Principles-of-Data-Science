 This dashboard is built in R Shiny and used R Markdown to publish on this website. This is the documentation of our application that describes technical details of how the application was built, how was data cleaned and organised to load for the visualisation of this dashboard.
 
 The “Touri-Scope” app allows a user to look up a country of choice in the world and year, and see what the arrival of tourist is for that country over the chosen year/month. It also allow the user to view the event happen on the country on the chosen year.

 The goal for the app is to be a tool to quickly get a broad-level grasp of the arrival of tourist in a given country and year/month. User should be able to answer question like “how many arrival of tourist in Malaysia on year 2021?”, “What are the significant event happen in Malaysia on year 2005?” and “Which country has the most significant arrival of tourist on year 2007?”
