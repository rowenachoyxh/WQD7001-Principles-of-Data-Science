 This dashboard is built in R Shiny and used R Markdown to publish on this website. This is the documentation of our application that describes technical details of how the application was built, how data was cleaned and organised to present the visualisation of this dashboard.
 
 The “Touri-Scope” app allows a user to look up a country of choice in the world and year, and see what the arrival of tourist is for that country over the chosen year/month. It also allows the user to view the event happen on the country on the chosen year.

 The goal of this project is to introduce a tool that can quickly get a broad-level grasp of the arrival of tourist visted Malaysia in a given country by year/month. User should be able to answer question like “how many arrival of tourist in Malaysia in year 2021?”, “What are the significant event happen in Malaysia for year 2005?” and “Which country has the most significant arrival of tourist in year 2007?”
