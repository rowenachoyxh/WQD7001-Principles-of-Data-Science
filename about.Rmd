## **Analysis on Reviving International Tourism in Malaysia**

```{r pressure1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

```



Tourism is one of the hardest hit sector by COVID-19 in Malaysia. In fact, tourism is essential for the success of many economies around the world. 



Thus, the interest of our project is to study: 


* _Which were the countries visited Malaysia the most before or after the pandemic?_ 

* _How did COVID-19 affect the number of tourists visiting Malaysia?_ 

* _Was there any seasonality on the arrivals of tourists from any specific country?_ 

Our motivation is to build a dashboard that allows people to analyse and better understand the trends of tourist arrivals to Malaysia before and after the pandemic. 

This is a group project for the subject of "**WQD7001 Principles of Data Science**" contributed by

Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture of Malaysia published the monthly tourist arrivals data from 2000 to 2021 by Country, which can be downloaded here: [tourism.gov.my](https://mytourismdata.tourism.gov.my).

The list of World events was scrapped from the Wikipedia world event pages.
